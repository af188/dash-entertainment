### About
This project was inspired by the [entertainment web app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/entertainment-web-app-J-UhgAW1X) Frontendmentor challenge. I built the app using fake data as a placeholder, before refactoring the code to access a REST API and display real-world information.
